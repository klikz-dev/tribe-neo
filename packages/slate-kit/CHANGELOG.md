# TribePlatform's Slate Kit Changelog

All **notable** changes to this packages will be documented in this file.

Changes go under one of the following categories:

- `Added` for new features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
- `Removed` for deprecated features removed in this release.
- `Security` to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.

Version impact (`major`, `minor`, `patch`) should also be noted with each entry to allow automatic parsing and version resolution.
For example:

We always keep an **Unreleased** section at the top. If a merge request has a notable change,
it should be placed under the corresponding category in this section.
